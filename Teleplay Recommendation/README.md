## Prediction and Recommendation System for Teleplay 
1. **Objective:** Developed a neural network-based model to predict teleplay ratings, achieving a Mean Squared Error 
(MSE) of 1, which was 0.5 lower than a linear regression model. Built a recommendation system using collaborative filtering to suggest teleplays to users.  
2. **Techniques Used:** Pre-processed data by encoding categorical variables and handling missing ratings. Implemented a fully 
connected neural network with 2 input features and 3 hidden layers. Used gradient descent for optimization and Mean Squared Error (MSE) for loss calculation.   
3. **Results:** Improved rating prediction accuracy and demonstrated superior performance of the neural network over 
linear regression. Proposed future enhancements include one-hot encoding and exploring alternative models like 
decision trees.
